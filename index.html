</header>	 

    <p class="about-text">I’d love to work on re-designing the New School Free Press, the universities press. For this project I would have to make use of an FTP server, Wordpress, Scss and HTML. I’m also working on creating custom templates depending on the article pages as well as trying to fix a plug-in that will allow authors to have multiple roles. This would be a little different then most of the options provided but to would be more extensive. For this I would need to build a custom homepage, logo re-design, individual story templates for news, features and op-ed, category pages, about page and more. It will be quite an extensive project but I have already started working a bit on the side and think this would be a great opportunity to be able to do more. 

Some sites that are used for inspiration for this web re-haul are the Times, The Cut, Vogue and more. </p>
